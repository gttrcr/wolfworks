# PiWolf

## What is PiWolf?
### PiWolf is
- a project that aims to spread and simplify the parallelization and distribution procedures of complex computing operations on low cost and low energy platforms, helping to reduce the economic and energy costs of large computing
- a c++ software for parallel and distributed computing based on the Mathematica and WolframKernel

## Why Mathematica and WolframKernel?
There is a huge amount of frameworks, platforms and projects for calculation: Matlab, Maxima, Maple and many libraries including Netlib, LAPAC, NAG but only Mathematica implements such a large amount of operators, functions, libraries and calculation logics.
